	<h1>Global Illumination Raytracer Assignment</h1>
	<h2>Collaborators: Maximillian McMullen (mrm8391) and Tanner Atwater (tja2703)</h2>

	<p>
		This page serves as a testament to our work on a custom-built raytracer. 
		The raytracer will evolve over time as we learn more about illumination
		and graphics in a Global Illumination class, with the results being shown 
		in biweekly "checkpoint" assignments.

	<h3><u>Checkpoint 1 - Setting the Scene (1/25/19)</u></h3>
	<p>Task: Reproduce the geometry of a scene, and determine the object locations and orientations</p>
	<p>Reference scene:</p>

    <h3><u>Checkpoint 2 - Raytracing Framework (2/12/19)</u></h3>
    <p>Task: Trace rays through camera to produce an image</p>
    <p>We updated our reference scene with new coordinates.</p>
    <p>Updated scene (rendered in Blender):</p>
    <img src="img/SetTheSceneV3.png">

    <p>Here is our raytracer's output for this scene. We set grayscale colors for this checkpoint, with the background as white and the objects as different grays.</p>

    <h3><u>Checkpoint 3 - Phong Illumination </u></h3>
    <p>Task: Update raytracer with Phong ambient, diffuse, and specular illumination</p>
    <p>The scene now includes colors and full shading with shadows.</p>

    <p>Here is our raytracer's output for this scene. The objects were changed to a red, blue, and green, and the background color was changed to blue.</p>
    <img src="img/checkpoint3.png">
	
	<h3><u>Checkpoint 4 - Procedural Shading</u></h3>
    <p>Task: Add a procedural checkerboard texture to the raytracer</p>
    <p>Due to our design of the materials, adding a checkerboard texture was not that difficult. However, due to our current tone reproduction, the colors are normalized and incorrect. This will be solved later</p>
	
    <img src="img/checkpoint4.png">

    <h3><u>Checkpoint 5 - Reflection</u></h3>
    <p>Task: Add reflection of light off of other objects</p>
    <p>We changed the tesselation level of the checkerboard, made its colors red and yellow, and updated the background color.</p>
    <p>This is our output for reflection with MAX_DEPTH = 1. Since only one object (the blue sphere) is reflective in this checkpoint, as specified in the instructions, the output is the same for all MAX_DEPTHs. </p>
