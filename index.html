	<h1>Global Illumination Raytracer Assignment</h1>
	<h2>Collaborators: Maximillian McMullen (mrm8391) and Tanner Atwater (tja2703)</h2>

	<p>
		This page serves as a testament to our work on a custom-built raytracer. 
		The raytracer will evolve over time as we learn more about illumination
		and graphics in a Global Illumination class, with the results being shown 
		in biweekly "checkpoint" assignments.

	<p>Task: Reproduce the geometry of a scene, and determine the object locations and positions</p>
