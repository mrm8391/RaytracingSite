	<h1>Global Illumination Raytracer Assignment</h1>
	<h2>Collaborators: Maximillian McMullen (mrm8391) and Tanner Atwater (tja2703)</h2>

	<p>
		This page serves as a testament to our work on a custom-built raytracer. 
		The raytracer will evolve over time as we learn more about illumination
		and graphics in a Global Illumination class, with the results being shown 
		in biweekly "checkpoint" assignments.

	<h3><u>Checkpoint 1 - Setting the Scene (1/25/19)</u></h3>

    <h3><u>Checkpoint 2 - Raytracing Framework (2/12/19)</u></h3>
    <p>Task: Trace rays through camera to produce an image</p>
    <p>We updated our reference scene with new coordinates.</p>
    <p>Updated scene (rendered in Blender):</p>
    <img src="img/SetTheSceneV3.png">

    <p>Here is our raytracer's output for this scene. We set grayscale colors for this checkpoint, with the background as white and the objects as different grays.</p>
    <img src="img/checkpointTwo.png">

    <h3><u>Checkpoint 3 - Phong Illumination </u></h3>
    <p>Task: Update raytracer with Phong ambient, diffuse, and specular illumination</p>
    <p>The scene now includes colors and full shading with shadows.</p>

    <p>Here is our raytracer's output for this scene. The objects were changed to a red, blue, and green, and the background color was changed to blue.</p>
    <img src="img/checkpoint3.png">
	
	<h3><u>Checkpoint 4 - Procedural Shading</u></h3>
    <p>Task: Add a procedural checkerboard texture to the raytracer</p>
    <p>Due to our design of the materials, adding a checkerboard texture was not that difficult. However, due to our current tone reproduction, the colors are normalized and incorrect. This will be solved later</p>
	
    <img src="img/checkpoint4.png">

    <h3><u>Checkpoint 5 - Reflection</u></h3>
    <p>Task: Add reflection of light off of other objects</p>
    <p>We changed the tesselation level of the checkerboard, made its colors red and yellow, and updated the background color.</p>
    <p>This is our output for reflection with MAX_DEPTH = 1. Since only one object (the blue sphere) is reflective in this checkpoint, as specified in the instructions, the output is the same for all MAX_DEPTHs. </p>

    <img src="img/checkpoint5.png">

	<h4><u>Shadow Bugfix</u></h4>
	<p>We fixed a shadowing bug which had prevented self-shadowing, and was causing incorrect specular highlights. Here is an updated image with a low reflection constant on the large sphere.</p>

	<img src="img/shadowBugfix.png">

	<h3><u>Checkpoint 6 - Refraction (sort of)</u></h3>
    <p>Task: Add refractive material</p>
    <p>After some refactor work, rays successfully transmit through objects and use the correct material of the medium a ray is going through. MAX_DEPTH for recursive illuminance calls
	is changed to 3, so that the transmission can be seen.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the refraction isn't fully polished yet. It appears to work, but is inverted. The refraction alongside the top of the sphere appears to be what should be refracting on the bottom. 
	Likewise, the bottom of the sphere refracts to the scene background whereas it should be along the top. One other small issue is that refracting objects still do cast shadow as well.
	The checkpoint otherwise works as expected.</p>

	<h3><u>Checkpoint 6 - Update</u></h3>
    <p>Fixed, look at dat refraction now B)</p>

    <h3><u>Checkpoint 7 - Tone Reproduction</u></h3>
    <p>Task: Correct tone output of radiances.</p>
    <p>We implemented Ward scaling and Reinhard scaling, which allow for dimmer or brighter scenes. </p>
    <p>Note the differences between the tone reproductions. Reinhard scaling made changes to the chromaticities of objects. </p>
    <h4><u>Ward Scaling, Low to High Light Level</u></h4>
    <img src="img/wardScalingLow.png"> <img src="img/wardScalingMid.png"> <img src="img/wardScalingHigh.png">
    <h4><u>Reinhard Scaling, Low to High Light Level</u></h4>
    <img src="img/ReinhartScalingLow.png"> <img src="img/ReinhartScalingMid.png"> <img src="img/ReinhartScalingHigh.png">

    <h3><u>Advanced Extra - Adaptive Logarithmic Tone Scaling</u></h3>
    <p>Task: Apply Adaptive Logarithmic Mapping to our scene, and compare results with basic Ward model.</p>
    <p>With a lot of parenthesis, we followed the given formula for luminance at each pixel: </p>
    <img src="img/logFormula.png">
    <p>where Lw is the luminance at the current pixel, and Lwmax is the maximum luminance of any pixel in the scene, each divided by the log-average 
    luminance of the scene. <i>b</i> was set to 0.85, as recommended in the paper, Adaptive Logarithmic Mapping For Displaying High Contrast Scenes (Drago, et. al. 2003, Eurographics). 
    The scene luminance values are scaled by the resulting "display luminance" Ld.</p>
    <h4><u>Adaptive Logarithmic Scaling, Low to High Light Level</u></h4>
    <img src="img/LogScalingLow.png"> <img src="img/LogScalingMid.png"> <img src="img/LogScalingHigh.png">
    <p>As you can see, the tones look bolder than Ward scaling. With adaptive logarithmic scaling, the background becomes dimmer as the scene becomes brighter. 
    Ward scaling keeps the background consistent, and Reinhard scaling brightens the background as the scene becomes brighter. </p>

    

	<h3><u>Advanced Extra - Open Shading Language</u></h3>
	<p>Task: Learn and experiment with Open Shading Language using Blender</p>
	<p>Following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CNyM_NdTDQ">the OSL tutorial</a> as instructed, we produced a volume shader that utilizes the Perlin noise function.</p>
	<img src="img/osl_tutorial.png">
	
	<p>For our custom shader, we produced a surface procedural shader that replicates a Pokeball! Blender's "glossy" BRDF shader is used for lighting.</p>
